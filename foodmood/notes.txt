what is optional chaining ?
ans/ 
Optional chaining is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to access properties of an object without the need to explicitly check if each property exists at every level of nesting. It provides a concise and safe way to handle potentially undefined or null values within nested objects and arrays.

Here's how optional chaining works:

Accessing Nested Properties:

Normally, if you try to access a property of an object that doesn't exist, JavaScript throws an error, typically "Cannot read property 'propertyName' of undefined".
With optional chaining, you can use the ?. operator to access nested properties of an object. If any intermediate property along the chain is null or undefined, the expression short-circuits, and the result is undefined.
